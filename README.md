# new_sandbox

A learning sandbox repository containing test files and experiments for educational purposes.

## About This Repository

This is a **monorepo** (monolithic repository) that contains multiple unrelated projects in one repository. This approach allows for easy organization of various learning experiments and test projects without needing to create separate repositories for each small project or experiment.

## Current Projects & Technologies

This repository currently includes experiments and test files for: 

- **Ada** - Ada programming language examples
- **Django** - Python web framework projects
- **React** - JavaScript UI library experiments
- **Dart/Flutter** - Mobile and web application development

## Future Additions

More languages, frameworks, and platforms may be added over time as learning continues. 

## Note

⚠️ This repository contains experimental and educational code. Projects here are for learning purposes and may not follow production best practices.

## Monorepo Structure

Each project or experiment is contained in its own directory, allowing for independent development while maintaining everything in a single repository for convenience. 

*Feel free to explore, but remember this is a work in progress!*
